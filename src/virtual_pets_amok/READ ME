READ ME for Virtual Pets Amok

Hello and welcome to The Doctor's Shelter for Pets! We have collected quite a few pets on our travels 
across time and space and they are excited to met you. We have organic pets (just a fancy way of saying pets
from Earth) and robotic pets of the Mark I variety. You can do everything from eating and watering the organic 
pets to making sure the robotic pets are oiled up and maintained so they don't get squeaky. We want all our
pets to be healthy and happy so make sure to play with all of them and take them for walks! Don't forget to 
clean the cages and litter boxes. We keep a clean ship here! I'm sure you will have a great time here with
all the companion pets here at The Doctor's Shelter for Pets. And remember... bow ties are cool.
